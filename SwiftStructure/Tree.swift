/*
 A tree represents hierarchical relationships between objects.
 A tree consists of nodes, and these nodes are linked to one another.
 Nodes have links to their children and usually to their parent as well. The children are the nodes below a given node; the parent is the node above. A node always has just one parent but can have multiple children.
